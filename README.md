Got it 👍 You want to join that GitHub repo as a collaborator.
Here’s how it works:

---

### 🔑 Important

* Only the **owner of the repo** (`gospelwilbart`) can add collaborators.
* You can’t add yourself – you need the repo owner to grant you access.

---

### ✅ Steps the **repo owner** must do:

1. Go to the repo 👉 [Building-a-Blog-Application](https://github.com/gospelwilbart/Building-a-Blog-Application.git)
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon in repo menu).
3. In the left sidebar, go to **Collaborators**.
4. Click **Add collaborator**.
5. Search for your GitHub username (`EliasMwita`? or whichever you use).
6. Click **Add** → You’ll get an invitation.
7. You accept the invite from **your GitHub notifications/email**.

---

### ✅ Once added, you can:

* Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gospelwilbart/Building-a-Blog-Application.git
cd Building-a-Blog-Application
```

* Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-changes
```

* Push to the repo:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-changes
```

👉 Do you want me to draft a **message you can send to `gospelwilbart`** asking them to add you as a collaborator?
